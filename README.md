# How to Install
(First, install [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) for your browser if you haven't aleady.)

The easiest way is to click this link to [install dizzydon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dizzy-labs/dizzydon/master/dizzydon_source.user.css) by opening the .user.css file and clicking <b>Install Style</b> in the top left of the screen that stylus opens.

After installing you can open the config menu by clicking the gear icon either on the management page or after clicking the icon in your browser.

# Updating
Open the management page for stylus and click the refresh icon for the style
Alternatively, follow the install instructions again for the new version and it will overwrite the old version.

# Themes
Themes are stripped down versions of dizzydon that only alter the colors and nothing else. They are meant to be used in addition to Dizzydon to allow custom color settings to be saved and shared.

Dizzydon themes are installed and used just like the base Dizzydon.
[Navigate to the themes folder](https://github.com/dizzy-labs/dizzydon/tree/master/themes) then open the raw <theme>.user.css file in your browser (basically click on of the files above to open it, then find and click the <b>"raw"</b> button) and install it with stylus. Then enable it on any site you use Dizzydon on so it overrides the colors.

# Troubleshooting and FAQ

* # The shadows are flickering
* * Drop shadows use hardware-acceleration, so this is like cause by your graphics hardware. Disable drop shadows in the settings menu.
